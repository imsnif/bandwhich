Contributions of any kind are very welcome. If you'd like a new feature (or found a bug), please open an issue or a PR.

To set up your development environment:
1. Clone the project
2. `cargo run`, or if you prefer `cargo run -- -i <network interface name>` (you can often find out the name with `ifconfig` or `iwconfig`). You might need root privileges to run this application, so be sure to use (for example) sudo.

To run tests: `cargo test`

After tests, check the formatting: `cargo fmt -- --check`

Note that at the moment the tests do not test the os layer (anything in the `os` folder).

If you are stuck, unsure about how to approach an issue or would like some guidance, you are welcome to contact: aram@poor.dev
